# Reflections
# Areas of Mastery
HTML Layout: An area I believed I was able get completed with minimal need for improvement was the HTML for my landing page. Which encouraged me to focus more time on the CSS elements.

# Challenges Faced
CSS Styling Elements: as I followed along with the scrimba lesson, I had to adapt to learn the lecturer's (Kevin) personal style of writing CSS. Kevin uses a shorthand style of writing his CSS and in order to do that, he puts all his html code in many classes. Although, this style of working was quite refreshing in terms of learning, it was a bit jarring to encounter.  

# Areas for Improvement 
I would improve my CSS skills and change the way I approach learning new styles of writing code.

# Overall Learning Experience
This project helped me realise and identify my state of my learning curve. I realised that coding is a very broad concept and each person must develop their own personal style of writing code. I found this realisation very exciting and actually made me want to learn more.
